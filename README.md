# KoestritzerGameDev
For development of the game


All files and whatnot will be posted here.
Try to communicate your changes with the other members of the team.
If possible, be on the IRC (rizon.net/chat #KoestritzerGameDev) while making changes.
I'll try to update the GitHub as much as possible.


Game status:

Current engine: GameMaker 8 Pro

Development stage: Prototype, Movement and shooting mechanics perfected


Update 1, late one Friday night in Germany:
Made the GitHub, uploaded the files (including a prototype complete with real live walking mechanics!).
I'm trying to use GML code instead of the GameMaker scripts because it makes more sense to me and it's more versatile.
Try to clean up my code; I'm pretty rusty and don't have the experience you guys have.


Update 2, 11/22/15:
I finished with the movement and shooting mechanics.
Again, the code is really messy. 
I don't know if you guys would rather have keep everything grouped tightly together and look shitty, or have everything spaced out and take up lots of lines of code, yet look really nice.
Also, I don't know if you'd rather have me make the movement and shooting mechanics into seperate scripts (kind of like methods) that I call in Link's step event (where almost the entirity of the code currently is).
Feel free to take a look at it and let me know what you think.
If Roman Reigns wins the WWE Championship at Survivor Series, I am going to be VERY angry.


Update 3, 11/25/15:
As indicated by my previous post, I am angry, and therefore had to take a two day break from programming. 
Anyways, I started today with the enemy AI. 
I am working on the movement right now, and should get to their attacks soonafter. 
I have not uploaded the most recent build to GitHub, so any downloads will be from Sunday.
:^)


Update 4, 11/26/15:
I completely rewrote the movement mechanics today to function better with the collision event.
Enemy movement is done.
Currently working on combat mechanics (ie knockback and death).
For now the character will take unlimited damage and the enemies will die whenever they're hit; I plan on implementing the RPG elements like hit points, mana, and experience points later.
Again, not uploading the newest build here because I don't feel the need to.
If you want me to, just ask.

Update 5, 11/28/15:
I coded knockback as well as a (very basic) HP mechanic.
I'm having problems with the collision detection on the enemies.
They don't walk through each other, but when they're touching and I am standing directly to above or below them (or on either side, it depends on their formation) they stop moving.
If someone could take a look at my code, I'd appreciate it.
Anyways, I'm calling for an IRC chat tomorrow on Rizon to get you guys all up to date.
Hope to see you there!

Final update?, 11/12/17:
I figured I'd update this before I forget. This project is pretty much dead, and I probably won't be revisiting it since I made such little progress and my code is so shit. Anyways, I have my Genesis code posted on here if you're interested in my current projects. I'm also making an RPG for the SNES using RPG Tsukuru 2, but won't be posting any of that here until I start hacking the ROM to make it a stand-alone game. Maybe I'll mess around with some of the emulators on GitHub too? I've already worked with SNES9xGx to get it to better suit my needs; I could make an SNES9xGx lite for those of you looking for an authentic SNES experience (no speedup mapped to the right stick, no extensive menu options, just the meat and potatoes). Chances are I'll be revisiting GameMaker (or maybe Unity) in the future, but for now I'm focusing on retro game development since that's more fun for me :^)
I hope to see you all in the future as I move on to bigger and better projects :D
