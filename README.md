# KoestritzerGameDev
For development of the game

All files and whatnot will be posted here.
Try to communicate your changes with the other members of the team.
If possible, be on the IRC (rizon.net/chat #KoestritzerGameDev) while making changes.
I'll try to update the GitHub as much as possible.

Update 1:
Made the GitHub, uploaded the files (including a prototype complete with real live walking mechanics!).
I'm trying to use GML code instead of the GameMaker scripts because it makes more sense to me and it's more versatile.
Try to clean up my code; I'm pretty rusty and don't have the experience you guys have.
